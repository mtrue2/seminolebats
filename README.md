This GitHub repo serves to compliment the manuscript "Forecasting the Distribution of a Range-Expanding Bat Reveals Future Response to Climate Change and Habitat" for submission to Acta Chiropterologica (in review). Within, you will find two .Rmd files which contain all R code used to produce the methods, analysis, and figures in the manuscript. "datawrangle.Rmd" concerns manipulating/filtering occurrence records and creating/calculating raster layers to be used in MaxEnt. "analysis" includes creating MaxEnt models, model selection, calculations in the results, and producing figures

For purposes of confidentiality, we do not provide the raw GPS occurrence record .csvs. I can provide a csv that contains county IDs of presences and background for purposes of replication upon request

Any questions or concerns may be directed to the first author at mtrue@vt.edu
